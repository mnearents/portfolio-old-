<h2 class="headline">PROBLEM</h2>
                    <p>To be honest, budgets are lame. It's not fun trying to guess how much I should spend on gas or groceries every month, especially taking into account money I don't even have yet. A better solution is to divvy up the money you have into savings goals. I founded Divvy to allow people to do just that.</p>
                    
             <h2 class="headline">Validation</h2>
  
            <p>I researched the concept amongst my social networking friends and found that people have a tendency to open multiple bank accounts in order to divvy up their money for different purposes. Most people had 2 to 4 bank accounts. One person had 8 or more bank accounts.

            </p>

                    <h2 class="headline">COMPETITORS</h2>
                    
                    <p>There are a couple of solutions that already exist. I discovered these during my research phase. I found these solutions to be inadequate.

                  </p>
                    
                  <h3>Mvelopes</h3>
                    
                    <p>Mvelopes is an overly-complicated virtual envelopes app. To set it up, you must enter your income, all expenses, and envelopes. The sum of your envelopes must match the total of your income. The user receives 20+ predefined envelopes and must delete undesired ones one by one. A few of them cannot be deleted. Every transaction that gets posted to your account must be dealt with. The app even has a reset feature if you fall too far behind, which to me sounds like the designers knew their app was hard to use, but instead of opting for a user-centered design, simply put crutches in place for the difficult features.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Simple Bank</h3>
                    <p>Simple bank, although I have not personally used it, seems like a promsing solution. The problem is you don't get to keep your own bank. Simple Bank is a bank, with it's own FDIC insured account and debit card. The application process is cumbersome and one must be approved to use the service. Users must scan documents in order to prove their identity.</p>

                    <h2 class="headline">WIREFRAMES &amp; MOCKUPS</h2>
                    
                    <p>I iterated through hundreds of mockups. I had been mocking up UI since the research began, so as my findings came to light, I iterated on the wireframes until I narrowed them down to the most basic and useful tasks. I was also heavily influenced by The Lean Startup by Eric Reiss. <br><br>Here are some screen shots of how the UI has adapted since its conception:</p>

                    <p>With Divvy, there are no predefined envelopes. You do not have to enter your income nor your expenses. Divvy doesn't currently show transactions, but when it does, users will only allocate transactions to goals if they so desire. Divvy is meant to be lightweight, and to give the user more freedom.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Divvy is currently in closed Alpha. We released an MVP with minimal features. It currently connects to your bank by sending an SMS to your bank and parsing the returned message. Divvy will be starting open Beta very soon. We have big plans for Divvy. We plan to validate current feature ideas, as well as study user activity to think of new features and paths for Divvy.

               <h2 class="headline-grey">Logo &amp; Identity</h2>
               
               <p>
               My main concern for the graphic design aspect of Audiomesh was the branding. I wanted to create a memorable logo, use a unique but nice looking color scheme, and use beautiful typography. My original intent was to use Brandon Grotesque black for my branding. It is a beautiful, sans-serif display font.
               
               </p>
                   
                    <div class="row image-block">

                    </div>
                   
                   <p>For the app icon, I played around with using the first letter of the name, as many apps do. I came up with the following concept:</p>
                   
                     <div class="row image-block">
                         <div class="col-sm-4 hidden-xs"></div>
                       <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"><a href="images/audiothrive/icons-first.png" data-lightbox="vd1" title="Click for bigger image"><img src="images/audiothrive/icons-first.png" alt="Audiothrive icons version 1"></a></div>
                        
                    <div class="col-sm-4 hidden-xs"></div>
                    </div>
               
                   <p>The idea is that the center piece of the A is a play button, as in play music. After sitting on this idea for a while, I decided that the play metaphor was not good enough. Iâ€™d rather use something graphical to represent sound, like a sound wave. So I came up with the following concepts:</p>
                   
                   <div class="row image-block">
                       <div class="col-sm-4 hidden-xs"></div>
                       <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"><a href="images/audiothrive/icons-second.png" data-lightbox="vd1" title="Click for bigger image"><img src="images/audiothrive/icons-second.png" alt="Audiothrive icons version 2"></a></div>
                        <div class="col-sm-4 hidden-xs"></div>
                    
                    </div>
                   
                   
                   <p>I think the soundwave will be a good visual cue for recording. Soundcloud and the iOS voice memo app use this symbol. I like the third concept because the center square in the waveform is a circle, signifying record rather than just audio in general.<br><br>
Logo and identity are still a work in progress.</p>
                   
                   
                    <h2 class="headline-grey">Color</h2>
                   
                   <p>I chose a marigold yellow for a couple reasons. First, when yellow is done right in a design, it is strikingly beautiful. Not too many apps use yellow as their primary color and so it is unique. Second, it is my wifeâ€™s favorite color. I like it, but my favorite color is blue. But how many apps use blue? Blue is almost too easy and too common.<br><br>
I wanted the yellow to be dark enough that white text would still be readable and white icons still decipherable. I am 
not a huge fan of the bumblebee black and yellow, although again, it can be done right.</p>
                   
                   <h2 class="headline-grey">Layout</h2>
                   
                   
                   <p>Here are some high-fidelity, but still not-yet-perfected mockups of the mobile layout. Ignore the placeholder tab bar.</p>

                <h1>Development</h1>
                   
                   
                   <p>I have been the sole UI developer on this project. I have been committing code to the online repository since March 30, 
2014. I began learning Objective C when I started working on this project. My background until then consisted of a little
Java experience through school-work and some apps I developed. I used Stack Overflow, a Stanford iOS7 online course, 
and the book iOS7 Programming Fundamentals by Matt Neuburg as my reference material. <br><br>

I have written over 7,000 lines of code (I counted 14,000+ but that counts blank lines and comments, so I am estimating 
about half of that).<br><br>

I have made over 160 commits to the Bit Bucket repository.<br><br>One large hurdle I overcame was the recording UI. I wanted something similar to Voice Memos. I scoured Stack Overflow, Github and every other site but no one seems to have replicated it. So I found a core graphics waveform view controller on github that did a few of the basic things I needed, but still lacked many important features such as scrolling through the waveform, showing the current time based on the scroll position, being able to overwrite the waveform visually (if I recorded over previous audio), etc. Also, if you recorded more than 5 seconds of audio, the performance of this waveform degraded until it was unnacceptable.<br><br>
                       I was able to implement scrolling by having the core graphics draw on a UIScrollView rather than a UIView. As the user records, I widen the content view to match the speed of the waveform being drawn.<br><br>To overcome the performance degredation, I had to create my own method to loop through only the visible part of the waveform when redrawing. That way if I have five minutes of audio, it is actually only drawing about six seconds on the screen.<br><br>I implemented overwriting by matching the index in the audio data array to the position of the seeker (the point at which recording happens in the waveform). I was able to remove the existing point from the array and insert the new point which created an overwriting effect.<br><br>To a seasoned programmer these may or may not seem like big accomplishments, but since I am self-taught and many people online complained about wanting these features but provided no solutions, I was proud of what I achieved with a little determination.</p>
                       
                       
<!--
                       I have learned a lot about responsive UI design for iOS with the use of layout constraints and size classes. Using constraints, I am familiar with how to make an interface adapt from one size iPhone to another and in some cases even from the iPhone to the iPad. Most applications use a separate storyboard for their iPad layout, as will I, but using constraints can make that work much easier. <br><br>

The interface I am developing is a tabbed interface that utilizes UITableViews in most views. I have gained extensive 
experience with UITableViews and knowledge of how they work. I have also had to subclass many objects such as 
UITableViewCell, UICollectionViewCell, UIButton, etc.<br><br>

In my sounds list, the UITableView displays cells that expand on touch to reveal more options. There are plenty of
examples online for expanding cells, but the big problem I ran into was hiding and revealing elements in the cell when 
other actions are taken. If a cell is expanded to show extra options not normally visible when the cell is 
collapsed, and a modal dialog is introduced, when the modal dialog is dismissed the cell will still be expanded but the 
contents will be hidden. Collapsing the cell then reveals the contents and they overlap other cells. I had to chase down 
dozens of bugs of this nature so that any conceivable action taken by a user would not produce this bug.<br><br>

I successfully created a folder data structure using NSMutableDictionary, NSMutableArray, and NSArray. The user is able
to create a folder and move data in and out of it. I am not a full-fledged programmer and like 
I said before, began learning Objectice C very recently, so to me this is an accomplishment.<br><br>

I am familiar with object-oriented programming due to my undergrad coursework and Android development 
experience. I have worked on model objects such as the User class to implement object-oriented capabilities.<br><br>

In order to save time, I also take advantage of open-source libraries whenever possible. Core Audio is extremely
complex and would take years to master. I am using an open-source github project for audio recording. I am also using 
open source custom UITableViewCell swiping to reveal hidden utility buttons, and a couple other features.-->
