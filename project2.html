                    <h3>Student Living Intranet Site</h3>
                    <p>I was selected as the visual designer for a student living intranet site my group designed. The idea was the create the perfect student apartment complex and the intranet site was there to create a sense of community and social interaction. I was given a list of components to mock up for this project. The components included a web and mobile app that allowed students to schedule their classes as well as social apps. Through this scheduling system they could set reminders. They could also look up friends' schedules and plan times to hang out. The intranet site also included a thrift store page. The idea behind the thrift store was that students living in the complex could take unwanted items down to the warehouse. Items in the warehouse would be logged and appear on the intranet site. Other students can see what is available in the warehouse and receive alerts for new items. Here are some mockups from that project (note: I did not design the fancy photoshop templates or the icons):</p>

                    <p>While at BYU-Idaho, I completed a usability design project in my HCI course, designed and coded my personal web site for web design, and completed multiple research projects in class and as extracurricular work
                    
                    <br><br>
                    The HCI project was to design a skin for Windows Media Player. We brainstormed, designed, conducted usability tests on our friends and roommates, and implemented the design using javascript.<br><br>
                        
                        For my web development class, we had to develop a personal web site using HTML, CSS, a little PHP, and javascript. Our HTML and CSS had to validate according to the W3C Markup Validation Service. It was this course and this project that I learned the core concepts web UI development.<br><br>

                        <h3>Research</h3>
                    <p>
                        I conducted several research projects in and out of class which taught me experimental design and quantitative data analysis. My research project titled "Cars Produce Inconsistent Trait Attributions With Brand Identifiers Removed was accepted into the Association for Psychological Science convention, Washington DC in 2011. This research and a meta-analysis I co-authored won me two first place prizes for social science posters at BYU-Idaho's Research and Creative Works Conference.<br><br>See my APS poster below:

                    <p><a href="cv-aug-2014.pdf" download>Download my complete Curriculum Vitae</a> for more information about research.</p>
                    <p>At NMSU, graduate students are required to complete a first-year project and a thesis. The first year project is not expected to become a publication or attain a high level of quality, it is merely an introduction to research as a graduate student. <br><br>
                    
                    My advisor, Dr. Igor Dolgov, already had a project lined up and so I chose to take advantage of the opportunity. Based on prior research, we examined the effect of cooperative and competitive video gaming on subsequent prosocial behaviors. Basically, if you cooperate versus compete with a gaming partner, will you be more or less prosocial afterwards?<br><br>
                        I conducted the literature review, brainstormed with Igor about experimental design, carried out the research in our lab, collaborated to analyze the data, and did the write-up for the finalized document. My professor combined this with the prior study and this was published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior.<br><br>

                Very quickly I was recognized for my visual design skills. I became the go to person to do high
fidelity mockups. My work was shown at IOD in Las Vegas and always received positive feedback.<br><br>

I also became the Leaison between visual design and UX. I worked directly with the lead designer on 
the visual design team assigned to our project. We held weekly meetings and distributed visual 
design work load. I contributed to brainstorming and problem solving on different visual design 
problems. Many of my proposed solutions were implemented into OTS.

                    <p>I was involved in a small amount of development work. I worked with Dojo to write functions for 
a user interface prototype. I also prototyped in HTML, CSS, javascript and jQuery. I was recognized 
for my ability to quickly implement changes in the prototype and became the go-to person to make 
changes and tweaks to the code.<br><br>

I developed multiple prototypes for various ideas I had. I submitted a patent disclosure for a user 
interface idea I came up with. Before I submitted the disclosure, I prototyped a version of the UI 
using the above mentioned libraries (not dojo). <br><br>

I modified a prototype written by someone else to illustrate some UI ideas I had for OTS (the vertically 
aligned components I talked about in the UX section). We were designing an interface that utilized 
tiles laid out in a grid. The layout was inefficient and messy, so I began wireframing and prototyping a 
version that stacked the tiles in a vertical list. The prototype I modified became the basis for the 
developer’s code.</p>
