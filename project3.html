                <p>Audiomesh (formerly called Audiothrive) is a software project. As a musician, I noticed a gap in the mobile tools domain. Musicians resort to many 
different solutions for audio creation, sharing, storage, and sychronization. I started this side project in March 2014 and it continues today. </p>

                <h1>The Process</h1>

<h2 class="headline">Filling A Need</h2>
                    <p>
                    I had unique insight into the problem of sharing audio as a musician and band member in several bands. It was always a hassle to share files, yes, even with services such as Google Drive. Drive is great, but getting the file to and from Drive is a hassle for audio recording. So I set out to create an app that does not require third party sharing services.
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    <h2 class="headline">Validation</h2>
                    
                  
                    
                    <p>I began some background research to confirm or deny my suspicions. I created an online questionnaire. 
                    
                   
                    
                    The most interesting finding was that, of those who responded, many indicated they had used a mobile device 
to record themselves while only 3 had not. This was interesting because my original idea years ago came at a time when mobile phones were not commonly used for such data intensive activities.<br><br>

I also found that a decent amount of musicians collaborate with other musicians. Very few indicated otherwise.<br><br>

There were other not so surprising findings and I collected a lot of demographic information. I decided to pursue
the mobile idea and see how popular mobile audio collaboration really was.
                   <br><br>
                    
                   
                    
                   I decided to look up all the bands I listen to and message them directly. I only
asked one question: What do you use to get (musical) ideas down when you’re not in a studio? The results from this 
research confirmed the mobile theory. An overwhelming majority of artists indicated using their cell phone to pass around ideas. And some of these artists are pretty famous (7 million Facebook followers or more, certified platinum and gold albums). Others were garage bands.<br><br>I abandoned my original idea of a feature-rich web site or fatty client and started to hone in on a simple mobile experience. Here is an idea from before I started my research:

                    <h2 class="headline">PERSONAS &amp; SCENARIOS</h2>
                    
                    <p>My ultimate goal was to cater to both the seasoned DIY musician, as well as someone who wouldn't know an audio mixer from a kitchen hand mixer. I am of the Don Norman mindset about personas, they are unnecessary in many situations because most users are the same. I had created personas for Audiomesh, but as I narrowed down my feature set, I abandoned them.
<br><br>

                    I also created 11 scenarios. Based on research results, I eliminated all but two of them.</p>
                    
                  
                    
                    <h2 class="headline">WIREFRAMES &amp; MOCKUPS</h2>
                    
                    <p>I iterated through hundreds of mockups. I had been mocking up UI since the research began, so as my findings came to light, I iterated on the wireframes until I narrowed them down to the most basic and useful tasks. I was also heavily influenced by The Lean Startup by Eric Reiss. <br><br>Here are some screen shots of how the UI has adapted since its conception:</p>

                    <p class="bump">From left to right: The sound feed, sound file organization, recorder interface, recorder interface in an alternate state.<br><br>As I continued to research, I began to realize that many of the features I planned to implement were unecessary. 
I concluded that people who use this app won’t care so much about play counts, and other metrics. They’re just trying 
to share and collaborate hassle-free. The sound feed became much simpler with only basic information.<br><br>

I was over-thinking the sound file organization. I don’t think people want the UI to dictate how they organize their files.
Instead of creating an intermediate screen where people would have to drill into the category, I divided it into two 
categories: current and finished. If one is still working on a file, it goes under current. If I want to set it aside, I publish it 
to finished. I also threw out the approval mechanism. I did this because my research showed that most people who 
collaborate do it with someone they know personally (band member, friend, acquaintance). I had been browsing sites where people collaborate with strangers. Most platforms built around the stranger idea (random 
collaboration with anyone in the world) have come and gone. I decided I did not 
want to target the stranger collaboration crowd. I am going after bands, artists, and people who are serious song writers. The fact that 
they are collaborating with people they know means the approval process will just be a hassle.<br><br>

The recorder went through some simplification. Instead of throwing all the functionality on the screen at once, I hid 
some of it in options menus (global settings menu top left, individual track settings in the caret drop down). The record 
button was given more prominence, uncessary controls were hidden until applicable (see fourth wireframe). Media 
and timer controls won’t appear until they are useful. This hones the user in on the required action, rather than making 
them think.</p>

                    <h3>Third Iteration</h3>
                     <div class="row image-block">
                        <div class="col-xs-12"><a href="images/audiothrive/audio-wireframes-3.jpg" data-lightbox="it3" title="Click for bigger image"><img src="images/audiothrive/audio-wireframes-3.jpg" alt="Third wireframes"></a></div>
                        
                    
                    </div>
                    
                     <p class="bump">From left to right: The sound feed, sound file organization, recorder interface, recorder interface in an alternate state.<br><br>The sound feed did not change much, but I did demote it to the overflow tab instead of the first tab slot. Since I didn’t 
want to target the stranger collaboration type user, I figured its priority should be much lower. <br><br>

As far as sound file organization, I gave up entirely on trying to force any sort of structure on the user. Because research indicated they 
are collaborating with friends or their band, they don’t care who "owns" the file, whether it is finished or not, 
etc. I wanted to take more of a cloud storage approach and just let them organize however they feel necessary. There 
would be a “create folder” option in the menu top left. I also made some of the more important options more salient, 
such as sharing the sound.<br><br>

The recorder underwent further simplification. More prominence to the record button. Even less on the screen when 
not necessary. I eliminated the help button due to the simplicity of the UI. I changed the arm track button from a circle 
to a check mark, which makes more sense and represents “readiness” better than a circle. In the alternate state I 
modified the toolbar and combined the media buttons with the “next” button. I also added a trash can icon to undo 
all changes during the current session. The user could also add a new track by pressing the “new track” button, rather 
than it appearing automatically, which might be confusing. Instead of a caret drop down, I began flirting with the idea 
of swiping the audio track aside to reveal utility buttons. It is less discoverable, but saves space (the caret is very 
pervasive).  I am still thinking about this one. </p>

                       <p class="bump">From left to right: Recorder interface, recorder alternate state, recorder alternate state, sound file organization.
<br><br>I finally eliminated the sound feed altogether. I did this for a couple reasons. First, I don’t think anyone will use it, at least 
until the app gets a large number of users. Second, I wanted to see if people would ask for it during beta testing. If so, 
add it back in. Third, to simplify the number of tabs. And forth, to speed up development. <br><br>

The recorder did not undergo too much change. The top left options button became a page title drop down. I saw this 
in an app and liked it a lot. I gave the “next” or “save” button more prominence by giving it a yellow background. Users 
need to know that once you record, this is the next thing you have to do to save the sound.<br><br>

For sound file organization, I modified some of the options within a sound and added the “new folder” icon to the top 
right. </p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    
                    <p>The interface has undergone several more modificatins, but this gives you an idea of my process. I am at the mercy of my small development team. I have no money to pay them, so progress is slow. So I keep analyzing and iterating. If it were up to me, I would have released an MVP long ago.</p>

                   <h2 class="headline">USABILITY TESTING</h2>  
                    
                    <p>I chose a guerilla approach with my friends. Whenever I'm around a musician friend, I ask them to try the app. I have run about five people through parts of the UI with generally positive feedback.<br><br>

Typically, 
people have an easy time recording a track, saving the sound and modifying 
the sharing settings. So far this is the only scenario I have tested. I used the app POP (Prototyping on Paper) to “paper” prototype using my Illustrator wire frames as well as tested actual code running on an iPhone.</p>

                    <h3>Card Sorting</h3>
                    
                    <p>During the first iteration of wire framing, I performed some card sorts with a couple of my friends. I had them prioritize and categorize different features in the app.

               <p>
               My main concern for the graphic design aspect of Audiomesh was the branding. I wanted to create a memorable logo, use a unique but nice looking color scheme, and use beautiful typography. My original intent was to use Brandon Grotesque black for my branding. It is a beautiful, sans-serif display font.
               
               </p>
                   
                    <div class="row image-block">
                        
                        <div class="col-sm-4 hidden-xs"></div>

                    </div>
                   
                   <p>For the app icon, I played around with using the first letter of the name, as many apps do. I came up with the following concept:</p>
                   
                     <div class="row image-block">
                         <div class="col-sm-4 hidden-xs"></div>
                       <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"><a href="images/audiothrive/icons-first.png" data-lightbox="vd1" title="Click for bigger image"><img src="images/audiothrive/icons-first.png" alt="Audiothrive icons version 1"></a></div>
                        
                    <div class="col-sm-4 hidden-xs"></div>
                    </div>
               
                   <p>The idea is that the center piece of the A is a play button, as in play music. After sitting on this idea for a while, I decided that the play metaphor was not good enough. I’d rather use something graphical to represent sound, like a sound wave. So I came up with the following concepts:</p>
                   
                   <div class="row image-block">
                       <div class="col-sm-4 hidden-xs"></div>
                       <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"><a href="images/audiothrive/icons-second.png" data-lightbox="vd1" title="Click for bigger image"><img src="images/audiothrive/icons-second.png" alt="Audiothrive icons version 2"></a></div>
                        <div class="col-sm-4 hidden-xs"></div>
                    
                    </div>
                   
                   
                   <p>I think the soundwave will be a good visual cue for recording. Soundcloud and the iOS voice memo app use this symbol. I like the third concept because the center square in the waveform is a circle, signifying record rather than just audio in general.<br><br>
Logo and identity are still a work in progress.</p>
                   
                   
                    <h2 class="headline-grey">Color</h2>
                   
                   <p>I chose a marigold yellow for a couple reasons. First, when yellow is done right in a design, it is strikingly beautiful. Not too many apps use yellow as their primary color and so it is unique. Second, it is my wife’s favorite color. I like it, but my favorite color is blue. But how many apps use blue? Blue is almost too easy and too common.<br><br>
I wanted the yellow to be dark enough that white text would still be readable and white icons still decipherable. I am 
not a huge fan of the bumblebee black and yellow, although again, it can be done right.</p>

                   <p>I have been the sole UI developer on this project. I have been committing code to the online repository since March 30, 
2014. I began learning Objective C when I started working on this project. My background until then consisted of a little
Java experience through school-work and some apps I developed. I used Stack Overflow, a Stanford iOS7 online course, 
and the book iOS7 Programming Fundamentals by Matt Neuburg as my reference material. <br><br>

I have written over 7,000 lines of code (I counted 14,000+ but that counts blank lines and comments, so I am estimating 
about half of that).<br><br>

I have made over 160 commits to the Bit Bucket repository.<br><br>One large hurdle I overcame was the recording UI. I wanted something similar to Voice Memos. I scoured Stack Overflow, Github and every other site but no one seems to have replicated it. So I found a core graphics waveform view controller on github that did a few of the basic things I needed, but still lacked many important features such as scrolling through the waveform, showing the current time based on the scroll position, being able to overwrite the waveform visually (if I recorded over previous audio), etc. Also, if you recorded more than 5 seconds of audio, the performance of this waveform degraded until it was unnacceptable.<br><br>
                       I was able to implement scrolling by having the core graphics draw on a UIScrollView rather than a UIView. As the user records, I widen the content view to match the speed of the waveform being drawn.<br><br>To overcome the performance degredation, I had to create my own method to loop through only the visible part of the waveform when redrawing. That way if I have five minutes of audio, it is actually only drawing about six seconds on the screen.<br><br>I implemented overwriting by matching the index in the audio data array to the position of the seeker (the point at which recording happens in the waveform). I was able to remove the existing point from the array and insert the new point which created an overwriting effect.<br><br>To a seasoned programmer these may or may not seem like big accomplishments, but since I am self-taught and many people online complained about wanting these features but provided no solutions, I was proud of what I achieved with a little determination.</p>

                       I have learned a lot about responsive UI design for iOS with the use of layout constraints and size classes. Using constraints, I am familiar with how to make an interface adapt from one size iPhone to another and in some cases even from the iPhone to the iPad. Most applications use a separate storyboard for their iPad layout, as will I, but using constraints can make that work much easier. <br><br>

The interface I am developing is a tabbed interface that utilizes UITableViews in most views. I have gained extensive 
experience with UITableViews and knowledge of how they work. I have also had to subclass many objects such as 
UITableViewCell, UICollectionViewCell, UIButton, etc.<br><br>

In my sounds list, the UITableView displays cells that expand on touch to reveal more options. There are plenty of
examples online for expanding cells, but the big problem I ran into was hiding and revealing elements in the cell when 
other actions are taken. If a cell is expanded to show extra options not normally visible when the cell is 
collapsed, and a modal dialog is introduced, when the modal dialog is dismissed the cell will still be expanded but the 
contents will be hidden. Collapsing the cell then reveals the contents and they overlap other cells. I had to chase down 
dozens of bugs of this nature so that any conceivable action taken by a user would not produce this bug.<br><br>

I successfully created a folder data structure using NSMutableDictionary, NSMutableArray, and NSArray. The user is able
to create a folder and move data in and out of it. I am not a full-fledged programmer and like 
I said before, began learning Objectice C very recently, so to me this is an accomplishment.<br><br>

I am familiar with object-oriented programming due to my undergrad coursework and Android development 
experience. I have worked on model objects such as the User class to implement object-oriented capabilities.<br><br>

In order to save time, I also take advantage of open-source libraries whenever possible. Core Audio is extremely
complex and would take years to master. I am using an open-source github project for audio recording. I am also using 
open source custom UITableViewCell swiping to reveal hidden utility buttons, and a couple other features.-->
