                <p>Divvy Money is an app that connects to your bank accounts and allows you to create financial goals, rather than relying on cumbersome and outdated budgeting systems.</p>

                <h1>User Experience</h1>

<h2 class="headline">PROBLEM</h2>
                    <p>To be honest, budgets are lame. It's not fun trying to guess how much I should spend on gas or groceries every month, especially taking into account money I don't even have yet. A better solution is to divvy up the money you have into savings goals. I founded Divvy to allow people to do just that.</p>
                    
             <h2 class="headline">Validation</h2>
  
            <p>I researched the concept amongst my social networking friends and found that people have a tendency to open multiple bank accounts in order to divvy up their money for different purposes. Most people had 2 to 4 bank accounts. One person had 8 or more bank accounts.

            </p>

                    <h2 class="headline">COMPETITORS</h2>
                    
                    <p>There are a couple of solutions that already exist. I discovered these during my research phase. I found these solutions to be inadequate.

                  </p>
                    
                  <h3>Mvelopes</h3>
                    
                    <p>Mvelopes is an overly-complicated virtual envelopes app. To set it up, you must enter your income, all expenses, and envelopes. The sum of your envelopes must match the total of your income. The user receives 20+ predefined envelopes and must delete undesired ones one by one. A few of them cannot be deleted. Every transaction that gets posted to your account must be dealt with. The app even has a reset feature if you fall too far behind, which to me sounds like the designers knew their app was hard to use, but instead of opting for a user-centered design, simply put crutches in place for the difficult features.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Simple Bank</h3>
                    <p>Simple bank, although I have not personally used it, seems like a promsing solution. The problem is you don't get to keep your own bank. Simple Bank is a bank, with it's own FDIC insured account and debit card. The application process is cumbersome and one must be approved to use the service. Users must scan documents in order to prove their identity.</p>

                    <h2 class="headline">WIREFRAMES &amp; MOCKUPS</h2>
                    
                    <p>I iterated through hundreds of mockups. I had been mocking up UI since the research began, so as my findings came to light, I iterated on the wireframes until I narrowed them down to the most basic and useful tasks. I was also heavily influenced by The Lean Startup by Eric Reiss. <br><br>Here are some screen shots of how the UI has adapted since its conception:</p>

                   <h2 class="headline">SOLUTION</h2>  
                    
                    <p>With Divvy, there are no predefined envelopes. You do not have to enter your income nor your expenses. Divvy doesn't currently show transactions, but when it does, users will only allocate transactions to goals if they so desire. Divvy is meant to be lightweight, and to give the user more freedom.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Divvy is currently in closed Alpha. We released an MVP with minimal features. It currently connects to your bank by sending an SMS to your bank and parsing the returned message. Divvy will be starting open Beta very soon. We have big plans for Divvy. We plan to validate current feature ideas, as well as study user activity to think of new features and paths for Divvy.
