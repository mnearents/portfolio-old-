                <h1>User Experience</h1>

<h2 class="headline">PROBLEM</h2>
                    <p>People with motor disability or who simply cannot grasp technology may need assistance for basic tasks such as making phone calls. Cell phones are small, complicated, and error-prone. Accidentally pressing the wrong button sends the user into an often unkown context with no obvious way of escape. Easy Dial overcomes these challenges for certain situations.<br><br>My idea was to convert the phone's screen into a giant dial button. I wanted to create a context in which mistakes were extremely difficult to make while the user-goal was easy to accomplish. Here is a storyboard I created for this idea:</p>
                    
                    <div class="row image-block">
                        <div class="col-xs-9"><a href="#" title="Click for bigger image"><img src="images/easydial/easydial-storyboard.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></div>
                    
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>I did not create a persona because my plan was to cater to Grandpa. He became my prototypical user, basically someone who is almost completely helpless. I figured if the app was downloaded, I might consider expanding my list of use cases. I knew in order to cater to Grandpa, I would need more than a giant dial button. I would also need to prevent error. Here is a list of features I implemented:</p>
                    
                    
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Automatically dial with speaker phone on</dt>
                        <dd>If Grandpa doesn't want to hassle with handling the phone, the caretaker can enable speaker phone mode which causes the phone to always dial with the speaker phone on. The phone can sit on the nightstand and Grandpa can simply talk. This allows user control and freedom and facilitates error prevention.</dd>
                        
                        <dt>Prevent phone from sleeping</dt>
                        <dd>Grandpa might not be able to find/manipulate the power button and lock screen. This keeps the phone on and prevents sleeping. This prevents error and promotes visibility of system status (the app is still there, ready to help). </dd>
                        
                        <dt>Three modes: Dial, Dial &amp; Text, or Text-Only</dt>
                        <dd>If Grandpa can't hear very well, he can elect to send a pre-determined text message. Simply press the button and the message sends. The text message is set by the caretaker and can act as a check-in (i.e. "Still doing okay") or an alert (i.e. "I need help"). Or the caretaker can set it up so both the text and dial button are visible, one for checking in the other for emergencies, etc. This allows user control and freedom.</dd>
                        
                        <dt>Change button color to Grandpa's preference</dt>
                        <dd>The caretaker can choose colors for the buttons that Grandpa can see well, there are several colors to choose from. This is more of an accessibility feature.</dd>
                        
                        <dt>After hanging up, app automatically brings dial screen back to front</dt>
                        <dd>This way Grandpa can make another phone call later without the need for navigating and finding Easy Dial on the phone. This makes use more efficient and prevents error.</dd>
                        
                        
                    </dl>
                    
                   <p>I also implemented a few minor features for the benefit of the person responsible for setting the app up for Grandpa:</p>
                    
                   <ul>
                        <li>Saves phone numbers you've used in memory for easy set up.</li>
                       <li>The last text message used is saved in memory to avoid the need to set it up on every use</li>
                       <li>The app can choose numbers from your contact list, or you can manually enter a number, whichever is less hassle for the user.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                   
                    
                    <h3>Issues</h3>
