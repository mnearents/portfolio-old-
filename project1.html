                    <p>I was involved through every stage of design for Data Server Manager. UX was pulled into the project very late in the process, so we had to do disaster control with development and gather requirements at the same time.<br><br>

I was involved in requirements gathering by conducting interviews, wire framing, building interactive prototypes using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Dojo and GridX.<br><br>
                        
Medium-fidelity mockups that I created were shown at Information On Demand in Las Vegas for user feedback.<br><br>
                        
Some highlights of the project:</p>

Batman and Robin. We were able to work very efficiently together.</li>
                        <li>Created an interactive prototype which development used in actual code</li>
                        <li>Received praise from a notoriously difficult-to-work-with project manager on design work I did.</li>

                    &quot;Hi [Greg] and Matt, <br>
During the [demonstration] yesterday I was totally wowed by the UI. It has come a long way since the [first] drop. I am very hopeful that customers will be wowed too! When I asked [Steven] about it he said both of you played an instrumental role in making it happen. I want to take a moment to say a BIG THANK YOU! Keep up all the good work!!&quot;
                    
                
                    

                    

                    
                    
                    

                    <h2 class="headline">Data Server Manager Mobile</h2>
                    
                   <p>
                    Having expressed an interest in mobile to my boss, I was given charge of the DSM mobile user-experience design work. No other UX members were involved directly in the mobile design. I worked with two mobile developers and bounced ideas off fellow UX team members.<br><br>

The existing mobile design was very confusing to navigate and it took me a long time to figure out how it worked. I was able to drive a much more user-friendly navigation and drill-down process.<br><br>

                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="headline">Another Mobile UI</h2>
                    
                   
                        <ul>
                        <li>Converted an existing web interface to mobile.</li>
                            <li>Tested my design against an alternative design in usability sessions.</li>
                            <li>My design was able to overcome some design flaws in the existing mobile design.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>
                   
                Very quickly I was recognized for my visual design skills. I became the go to person to do high
fidelity mockups. My work was shown at IOD in Las Vegas and always received positive feedback. As you can see the released version of Data Server Manager is not pretty. I did not contribute to the final design.<br><br>

I also became the Leaison between visual design and UX. I worked directly with the lead designer on 
the visual design team assigned to our project. We held weekly meetings and distributed visual 
design work load. I contributed to brainstorming and problem solving on different visual design 
problems.

                    <p>I was involved in a small amount of development work. I worked with Dojo to write functions for 
a user interface prototype. I also prototyped in HTML, CSS, javascript and jQuery. I was recognized 
for my ability to quickly implement changes in the prototype and became the go-to person to make 
changes and tweaks to the code.<br><br>

I developed multiple prototypes for various ideas I had. I submitted a patent disclosure for a user 
interface idea I came up with. Before I submitted the disclosure, I prototyped a version of the UI 
using the above mentioned libraries (not dojo). <br><br>

I modified a prototype written by someone else to illustrate some UI ideas I had for DSM (the vertically 
aligned components I talked about in the UX section). We were designing an interface that utilized 
tiles laid out in a grid. The layout was inefficient and messy, so I began wireframing and prototyping a 
version that stacked the tiles in a vertical list. The prototype I modified became the basis for the 
developerâ€™s code.</p>
